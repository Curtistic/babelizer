<h2>What is Babelizer?</h2> 
<p>
	Babelizer is a toy that humorously exposes the inadequacy of machine translation.  You type in a phrase, choose a language, and the Babelizer uses the 
    <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">Altavista translation web site</a>
    to translate between English and your chosen language until the result no longer mutates.
</p>
<pre>    I speak other languages real good.

    Je parle l'autre vrai bon de langages.

    I speak other good truth about languages.

    Je parle l'autre bonne v&eacute;rit&eacute; au sujet des langages.

    I speak the other good truth about the languages.
</pre>
<p>
    I got the idea from
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?oi=djq&amp;ic=1&amp;selm=an_318493472">this
    Usenet message</a> several years ago.  You can play with an online version
    of the thing <a href="http://babel.MrFeinberg.com/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Babelizer is free software. It is free as in beer, and it is 
	free as in redistributable with source code, as explained 
	in the <a href="#license">license</a>, below.
</p>


<h2>How do I install Babelizer? </h2> 
<p>
	Install the application by copying it onto your hard drive.
</p>

<h2>How do I uninstall Babelizer? </h2> 
<p>
	Drag it to the Trash; empty the trash.
</p>

<h2>Why do I keep getting error messages?</h2> 
<p>
	This program works by accessing the 
	<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">Altavista translation web site</a>.
	Sometimes they can't keep up with the volume of translation requests
	coming from all of their users,
	and you'll get an error message.  I report these problems via 
	red status messages at the bottom of the window.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, if you see an error message that you think is unrelated
    to these kinds of problems, I welcome your 
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/babelizer/issues/list">bug reports</a>.
</p>

<h2>What do you mean, &quot;free&quot;?</h2>

	and redistributable, per the terms of the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.
